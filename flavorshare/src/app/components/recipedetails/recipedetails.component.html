    <p class="info">Pizza is one of the most beloved and versatile foods in the world, cherished for its delicious simplicity and endless variety. Originating in Italy, pizza began as a humble dish for the working class — a flatbread topped with simple ingredients like tomatoes, cheese, and herbs. Over time, it evolved into a global phenomenon, with each culture and region adding its own unique twist. At its core, pizza is about balance: the crispy yet chewy crust, the rich and tangy sauce, the gooey melted cheese, and the endless options for toppings, from classic pepperoni and mushrooms to adventurous choices like figs, arugula, or spicy buffalo chicken. Whether it’s cooked in a traditional wood-fired oven or crafted as a thick, cheesy deep-dish style, pizza brings people together, offering a meal that feels comforting, celebratory, and deeply satisfying. Beyond being a favorite comfort food, pizza has become a canvas for culinary creativity, inspiring gourmet versions with artisanal ingredients as well as nostalgic frozen varieties found in every grocery store. No matter how it’s served — in a bustling Italian pizzeria, at a family gathering, or during a casual night in — pizza remains a symbol of sharing, enjoyment, and simple pleasures that never go out of style.</p>

    <h1 class="ingredients">How to prepare it</h1>
    <p class="info">1. Prepare the Dough
        If making dough from scratch, mix flour, yeast, warm water, sugar, salt, and olive oil.
        Knead the dough for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
        Let it rise in a warm place for 1–2 hours until it doubles in size.
        <br>2. Preheat the Oven
        Preheat your oven to 250°C (480°F) — the hotter, the better for pizza!
        If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.
        <br>3. Shape the Dough
        On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a circle (or rectangle) about 0.5 cm thick.
        Transfer it to a pizza peel, baking tray, or parchment paper.
        <br>4. Add the Sauce
        Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.
        <br>5. Add Cheese and Toppings
        Sprinkle mozzarella cheese generously over the sauce.
        Add your favorite toppings (pepperoni, vegetables, mushrooms, etc.).
        Drizzle a little olive oil on top for extra flavor.
        <br>6. Bake the Pizza
        Place the pizza in the hot oven.
        Bake for about 8–12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
        <br>7. Add Fresh Touches (Optional)
        After baking, you can add fresh basil, arugula, or a drizzle of olive oil for extra freshness.
        <br>8. Slice and Serve
        Let the pizza cool for a minute or two, then slice it up and enjoy!</p>
